 <p>The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado is a mid-size four-wheel drive vehicle in the Toyota Land Cruiser range. It is produced by the Japanese car maker, Toyota. The Prado is one of the smaller vehicles in the range. From 2009, the Prado is based on Toyota's J150 platform.

The Prado may also be referred to as Land Cruiser LC70, LC90, LC120, and LC150 depending on the platform. In some markets (eg UK) it is known simply as the Toyota Prado.

In North America, the Prado is not part of the Land Cruiser range; the rebadged Lexus GX occupies the Prado's position in luxury trim. The GX uses practically identical body panels and V8 engine.
